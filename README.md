## Secrets management

Application secrets are no longer stored in a local `.env` file. Configure a self-hosted HashiCorp Vault and provide `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables (or Docker secrets) when running the application. Secrets are looked up from Vault at `l3arn-labs/<SECRET_NAME>` and fallback to values in `/run/secrets/<SECRET_NAME>` or environment variables.

## Pre-commit hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with `detect-secrets` to scan for secrets before every commit.

Install the hooks after cloning:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

This project is fully containerized and can be run with Docker Compose.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/l3arn-labs.git
    cd l3arn-labs
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file from the example:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Update the `.env` file with your secrets, or use the default values for local development.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Secrets Management

Application secrets are managed by HashiCorp Vault. The `docker-compose.yml` file includes a Vault service for local development.

When running the application with Docker Compose, the backend will automatically connect to the local Vault service.

For production deployments, you will need to provide the `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables (or Docker secrets) to the backend service.

## API Map

The backend API is a FastAPI application with the following endpoints:

*   **Auth** (`/api/v1/auth`)
    *   `POST /token`: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.
        *   **Request Body:** `username`, `password`
        *   **Response:** `access_token`, `token_type`
*   **Users** (`/api/v1/users`)
    *   `GET /me`: Get the profile of the currently authenticated user.
    *   `PUT /me`: Update the profile of the currently authenticated user.
*   **Courses** (`/api/v1/courses`)
    *   `GET /`: Get a list of all available courses.
    *   `POST /`: Create a new course (instructors only).
    *   `GET /{course_id}`: Get the details of a specific course.
    *   `PUT /{course_id}`: Update a course (instructors only).
    *   `DELETE /{course_id}`: Delete a course (instructors only).
*   **Lessons** (`/api/v1/lessons`)
    *   `GET /courses/{course_id}/lessons`: Get a list of all lessons for a course.
    *   `POST /courses/{course_id}/lessons`: Create a new lesson for a course (instructors only).
    *   `GET /{lesson_id}`: Get the details of a specific lesson.
    *   `PUT /{lesson_id}`: Update a lesson (instructors only).
    *   `DELETE /{lesson_id}`: Delete a lesson (instructors only).
